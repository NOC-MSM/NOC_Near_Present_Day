At its simplest, Zarr can be considered a cloud-native alternative to netCDF files since it consists of binary data files (chunks) accompanied by external metadata files.</p> <p>One important difference between archival file formats (e.g., netCDF) and Zarr is that there is no single Zarr file. Instead, a Zarr store (typically given the suffix .zarr - although this is not a requirement) is a directory containing chunks of data stored in compressed binary files and JSON metadata files containing the array configuration and compression used.</p> <p>Zarr works especially well in combination with cloud storage, such as the JASMIN object store, given that users can access data concurrently from multiple threads or processes using Python or a number of other programming languages.</p> <p>Click here more information on the Zarr specification.</p> <p>A Brief Introduction to Icechunk</p> <p>Icechunk is an open-source, cloud-native transactional tensor storage engine designed for N-dimensional data in cloud object storage. At its simplest, Icechunk can be considered a \"transactional storage engine for Zarr\", meaning that Icechunk manages all of the I/O for reading, writing and updating metadata and chunk data &amp; keeps track of changes (referred to as transactions) to the store in the form of snapshots. </p> <p>In place of Zarr store, users create an Icechunk repository, which functions as both a self-contained Zarr store and a database of the snapshots resulting from transactions (e.g., updating values or writing new values in the store). </p> <p>This allows Icechunk repositories to support data version control, since users can time-travel to previous snapshots of a repository.</p> <p>Click here for an overview of Icechunk.</p>"},{"location":"outputs/#method-1-accessing-icechunk-repositories-using-the-oceandatastore-library","title":"Method 1: Accessing Icechunk Repositories using the OceanDataStore library:","text":"<p>The simplest way to access ERA-5 Near-Present-Day simulation outputs is to use the OceanDataStore Python library designed to streamline accessing ocean model outputs stored in cloud object storage.
