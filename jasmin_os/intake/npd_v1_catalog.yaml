  eORCA1_JRA55v1:
    description: National Oceanography Centre (NOC) eORCA1-JRA55v1 Near-Present-Day ocean-sea ice simulation output. The eORCA1-JRA55v1 configuration consists of a 1 degree global ocean model (NEMO v4.2) with 75 z* vertical levels coupled to the Sea Ice modelling Integrated Initiative (SI3) sea ice model. The atmospheric forcing is provided by the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA55-do) for the period 1976-2023. The simulation is initialised using World Ocean Atlas 2023 conservative temperature and absolute salinity climatologies (1971-2000 average) and begins with a 3-year spin-up period using repeated 1976 JRA55-do atmospheric forcing.
